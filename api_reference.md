Versioning

The NovaLink API uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Each API version is denoted as major.minor.patch:

    Major: Breaking changes.
    Minor: Non-breaking changes, new features.
    Patch: Bug fixes and optimizations.

To ensure backward compatibility, older versions of the API will continue to function even after new versions are released, but deprecated endpoints will notify users with a warning.
